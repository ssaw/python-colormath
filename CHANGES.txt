Backwards Incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Minimum Python version is now 2.7.
* Color.convert_to() is no more. Use colormath.color_conversions.convert_color()
  instead. API isn't as spiffy looking, but it's a lot less magical now.
* RGBColor channels are now [0..1] instead of [1..255]. Can get the upscaled
  Can use RGBColor.get_upscaled_value_tuple() to get the upscaled values.
* RGBColor.set_from_rgb_hex() was replaced with a RGBColor.new_from_rgb_hex(),
  which returns a properly formed RGBColor object.
* RGBColor no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* HSL no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* HSV no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* CMY no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* CMYK no longer accepts observer or illuminant kwargs.
* Removed 'debug' kwargs in favor of Python's logging.
* Completely re-worked exception list. Eliminated some redundant exceptions,
  re-named basically everything else.

Features
^^^^^^^^
* Python 3.3 support added.
* Added tox.ini with supported environments.
* Removed the old custom test runner in favor of nose.
* Replacing simplified RGB->XYZ conversions with Bruce Lindbloom's.
* A round of PEP8 work.
* Added a BaseColorConversionTest test class with some greatly improved
  color comparison. Much more useful in tracking down breakages.
* Eliminated non-matrix delta E computations in favor of the matrix equivalents.
  No need to maintain duplicate code, and the matrix stuff is faster for bulk
  operations.

Bugs
^^^^

* Corrected delta_e CMC example error. Should now run correctly.
* color_diff_matrix.delta_e_cie2000 had an edge case where certain angles
  would result in an incorrect delta E.
* Un-hardcoded XYZColor.apply_adaptation()'s adaptation and observer angles.

1.0.9
-----

Features
^^^^^^^^
* Added an optional vectorized deltaE function. This uses NumPy array/matrix
  math for a very large speed boost. (Eddie Bell)
* Added this changelog.

Bugs
^^^^
* Un-hardcode the observer angle in adaptation matrix. (Bastien Dejean)

1.0.8
-----

* Initial GitHub release.
