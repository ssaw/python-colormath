Installation
============

python-colormath currently requires Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+. There are no
plans to add support for earlier versions of Python 2 or 3. The only other
requirement is NumPy_.

For those on Linux/Unix Mac OS, the easiest route will be :command:`pip` or
:command:`easy_install`::

    pip install colormath

If you are on Windows, you'll need to visit NumPy_, download their binary
distribution, then install colormath.
